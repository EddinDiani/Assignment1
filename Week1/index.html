      <h2>My Vision for Tech in Transport</h2>
      <p>Working in the public transport sector opened my eyes to many challenges, particularly the lack of real-time communication between passengers and service providers. I am passionate about building systems that use SMS, WhatsApp, and phone calls to ease communication and make the incoming BRT in Kenya more efficient and inclusive.</p>

      <h2>Power Learn Project, A Game Changer</h2>
      <p>The PLP Academy has offered me a scholarship that is changing my life. It’s not just teaching us code, it is equipping us to solve real African problems using technology. It’s the push I needed to fully enter the tech space and make impact.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="future">
      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>This is only the beginning. I believe that with the right connections, mindset and tools, tech can solve many of Africa’s biggest challenges. I’m ready to contribute, to build, and to innovate, starting with better living, fooa and transport systems for everyone.</p>
